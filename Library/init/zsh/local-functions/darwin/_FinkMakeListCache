# function to accompany completion function _fink
# generates completion cache
# The fink function will run this in the background after fink commands 
# such as selfupdate|selfupdate-cvs|selfupdate-rsync|install|remove|purge|reinstall|index|update|update-all
# are issued, to ensure that the completions for installed, outdated, and unistalled packages remain
# current.

 # Define a function that caches the listings of fink programs that are either
 # installed, not installed, or installed but need to be updated
 # for use in _fink completion function

function MakeListCache {
	# Store package list caches here:
        command mkdir -p ~/.zsh/cache
	# list installed but out of date programs:
		command /sw/bin/fink list -o | command awk '{print $2}'  >| ~/.zsh/cache/outdated_finkpkgs
    # list of uninstalled programs:
		command /sw/bin/fink list -n | command awk '{print $1}' >| ~/.zsh/cache/uninst_finkpkgs
	# list of installed programs:
		command /sw/bin/fink list -i | command awk '{print $2}'  >| ~/.zsh/cache/inst_finkpkgs
	}

# Now run the function to (re)make the cache lists
